        Hi there! My name is Caroline, and I currently a student at the National University of Ireland, Galway where I am completing my Master's Degree in Software Design & Development. When I'm not coding I love to travel and visit friends. 
        <br><br>
        I created this website out of the desire to have a place for unbiased news. Here, you can read a variety of different perspectives and views. This website is designed to push you out of your comfort zone and present you news you may not otherwise see. It is my hope that this website leads us to become more informed voters.
        <br><br>
        Keep watching this space as this project grows and develops!
